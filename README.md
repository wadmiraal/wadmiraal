# Hi, I'm Wouter

I'm a husband and father of 2.

I love solving complex problems and finding elegant solutions.

When it comes to software development, I love beautiful and simple code (see [Slippers](https://github.com/wadmiraal/slippers) or [wutils](https://github.com/wadmiraal/wutils/)). I've worked as a designer, frontend, backend, fullstack, sysadmin, and devops, before finally moving back to frontend development when I joined @SonarSource.

I'm currently working as an Engineering Manager at @SonarSource inside the SonarQube Team.
